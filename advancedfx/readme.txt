Installation:

You need to install Blender Source Tools first
( http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/ ), since we depend on it.
This version of afx-blender-scripts was built using Blender Source Tools 2.7.1.

If you have a previous version of afx-blender-scripts installed, uninstall
it first through Blender!

afx-blender-scripts is installed like the Blender Source Tools are.

Of course when using AGR import you need the decompiled(player) models
in a folder structure like it is in CS:GO's pak01_dir.pak
(We recommend http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool ).



Known problems:

Using the AGR Import menu entry causes the Blender Source Tools import menu
entry not to function anymore until you restart Blender!



Usage:

The scripts can be accessed through the entries in the import menu
(AGR and BVH import) and export menu (BVH export).

Don't forget to enter the "Asset Path" when using AGR import, it needs to be
the full path to the folder structure with the decompiled models.
